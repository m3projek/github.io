This project is designed to enhance the livelihoods of musicians across Melanesia by nurturing creative social networks that support music and activities centered around community justice.

To accomplish this aim, our research seeks to better understand the changing technologies and networks that circulate community-building music through research with musicians, listeners, designers and NGOs in New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu. We focused upon three core areas: Content, Circulation and Capital.

1. Content: Content is concerned with the themes in the songs produced by Melanesian musicians and the ways in which aspects of the music are conveyed through imagery, instruments, music genres, language and other key dimensions of the music. Our partners are concerned with increasing and enhancing the inclusion of West Papua, Kanaky, and other messages in Melanesian music.

In this project we have been exploring the question: How and in what ways is music being used to create solidarity and spread the message for decolonization and community justice across Melanesia?

2. Circulation: Circulation is focused upon the ways in which music is disseminated and shared, particularly as they are shaped by mobile and digital media. This research is in dialog with our partners who are focused upon spreading the music within and beyond the usual channels.

We have been examining the following questions: How are mobile phones and associated technologies being used to circulate music across Melanesia? How and in what ways are and/or could communities and NGOs mobilise technologies more effectively?

3. Capital: Capital focuses upon the key institutions and networks that comprise the music industry within and across Melanesia, with particular attention to the contemporary moment and the consequences of digital media for musicians.  The [Wantok Foundation](https://www.wantokmusik.org/) and [Further Arts](http://www.furtherarts.org/) are particularly concerned with issues such as renumeration and intellectual property.

To understand capital our research has focused upon the following questions: How are local music industries in Melanesia changing? How are new forms of production, circulation and distribution impacting the ways in which musicians earn their livelihoods?

Building upon this research, and in conversation and collaboration with Further Arts and the Wantok Musik Foundation, we developed and tested a mobile phone applications to create and circulate mobile music. We also incorporated the book “We have come to Testify” and a CD into the app. The app and its use have been developed with the needs of Melanesian communities and users.
