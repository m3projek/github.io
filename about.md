# About the m3 Project

Mobile phones and other digital media are used extensively in Melanesia to share and to listen to music as well as for more traditional communication purposes. These practices also play a key role in grassroots justice movements. This project seeks to understand how different Melanesian communities use digital media and music to mobilise. We employ an action research approach to develop software that allows musicians to more affordably and disseminate community-building music. In collaboration with two community-based industry partners—the Wantok Musik Foundation and Further Arts—the project seeks to support and enrich the range of technologies available to Melanesian musicians and peace-seeking groups and investigate ways in which mobile phones and technology may be providing new sources of livelihood for musicians.
